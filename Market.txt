	Annual wages for web designers are generally offered between $30,424 and $65,599 in Canada. 
The median wage is $43,598.

The median wage is $48,812.
	Between 2013 and 2015, employment positions available for web designers and developers 
have been expected to be fair in the Greater Toronto Area. During the time of the 2011 National 
Household Survey, records show that there were 6700 people working in the position found in 
the region. From 2012 - 2016, the Average Annual Growth Rate has been estimated of being 2.3%, 
in contrast to the annual 0.7% increase in all employment positions.
	This trend supposedly occurs due to there being a large concentration of firms and 
companies that work with information technology in the area. Outside of urban areas such as the GTA,
there are limited jobs available for web designers and developers with next to none in the 
Maritime provinces and territories.
