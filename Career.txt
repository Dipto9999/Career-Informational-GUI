	Website designers and developers are in charge of designing, 
developing, and creating sites on the Internet or on a Intranet. They 
carry this out by primarily conducting research of Internet and Intranet sites.
 
	Web designers are more focused on how the site appears to the 
customer (in the case of an Intranet, it may be workers external to the organization, 
customers, or other employees) and how they can interact with its features. They 
need to be aware of the appeal of their site in terms of usability and convenience, 
but also general display which is able to emphasize and contrast colours and images on the site. 
They want the site to be as easily used and accessible as possible so customers return to their site.

	Web developers are more concerned on how the site functions than how it appears. 
They want the customer (in the case of an Intranet, it may be workers external to the 
organization, customer, or other employee) to come to their site and finish the task they
aimed to complete. They can keep sites running and working efficiently and 
are highly knowledgeable about web forms (also referred to as HTML forms) and are 
described to be the back-end of a company's website.
